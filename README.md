# Getting Started with Gym Bunny

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The website is a comprehensive exercise resource that allows users to tailor their workout routines to their specific needs. Upon landing on the homepage, users are presented with a selection of exercise categories to choose from, as well as a list of muscle groups to target.

Once users have selected their preferences, they are directed to a browse page that displays a variety of exercises relevant to their chosen categories and muscle groups. The browse page includes practical examples of each exercise, as well as pagination to make it easy to navigate through the results.

Clicking on an individual exercise takes users to a detailed exercise page that provides more information about the exercise, including step-by-step instructions and helpful tips. Additionally, the website pulls related videos from YouTube to supplement the written instructions and give users a better understanding of proper form and technique.

Finally, the website also includes a section that displays similar exercises, providing users with additional options and variations to incorporate into their workout routines. Overall, this website is a valuable tool for anyone looking to create a personalized exercise regimen tailored to their specific goals and needs.
